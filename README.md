PlanningPoker
=============

An application for helping remote teams participate in planning poker estimation sessions and sending them off to pivotal tracker.

This project is primarily a learning tool for me, but eventually I would like to start using it at work with my team.

The Idea
========

- Team members will log in to a given url, and there will be a dashboard area for loading up any stories to be estimated.
- Team members will cast their estimates and when all estimates are in they will be revealed at the same time.
- The winning estimate can also be pushed directly to pivotal once it has been agreed upon by the team.
- Statistics about estimate duration, team member estimates and tendencies and other such metrics can be recorded.
